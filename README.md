# Gamma-Ray Bursts: Observational Techniques and Data Analysis

This repository presents a full Python-based workflow for analyzing real gamma-ray data from high-energy missions such as **EGRET**, **BATSE**, and **Fermi GBM**. It is developed as a hands-on project for learning **observational techniques**, **data mining**, **sky visualization**, and **spectral analysis of GRBs** (Gamma-Ray Bursts).
